# Server side to my react app
Welcome to the server side of my web development.
I made use of typescript to write my server side
I made use of mongoDB for my database


# To run the server side
I used yarn as my package manager
Make sure you are on the server folder on the terminal
On your terminal, type yarn (to include the node_modles)

After completion, type yarn compile (to recompile the project)
Open another terminal, type yarn dev (to run the server)

(After running the server, don't close the terminal. Open another terminal to run the client side. Go to the README in client folder to know how to run the client side)

Thank you!
